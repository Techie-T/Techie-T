- 👋 Hi, I’m @Techie-T
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Designing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the front end of Web development 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on working with designers to implement user interfaces ensuring websites work on various devices and screen size and also collaborating on projects using frameworks like React or Angular. Also collaborate on working together on coding tasks in real-time and reviewing eachother's code to ensure quality and maintainability.

- ⚡ Fun fact: The first website created was in 1991 by a man called Tim Berners-lee and it is still online and accessible today :).
